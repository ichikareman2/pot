  Improvements, bugs:
    ☐ look into form.parse callback @api
    ☐ FIX: temporary folder should not show up in root.. @api
      hide it or better yet, make a folder for pot-api related files and make separate folder for destination and temporary files
    ☐ potapi closes on unhandled exceptions @api
    look into error handling in express docs 
    ✔ upload file creates its own folder @api @done(17-11-12 08:53)
    remove mkdir from upload file
    ✔ browse endpoint should not show the whole path to the file @api @done(17-11-12 08:54)
      remove path property since it is not going to be used
    ☐ for directory component, add a component to contain each part of directory since they all have same style? (composition vs inheritance)
    ☐ list getting too long, page border doesnt adjust
    ☐ logs @api
    ✔ on startup, make sure destination exists @api @done(17-11-12 01:52)
      make sure the directory to upload files to, pointed in the config, exists, if not make it, if error, stop the application logging the problem
    ☐ make commands/build for production and dev @api
    ☐ make commands/build for production and dev @frontend
