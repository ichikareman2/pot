  Socket.IO:

  Improvements, bugs:
    ☐ make progress bar of upload
      ☐ return progress change like on progress(45%) to notify front end @api
        probably have to learn socket io.. check socket io or primus
      ☐ get progress from api and make changes to some kind of progress bar @frontend
        probably have to learn socket io implementation for receiving messages
    ✔ FIX: pot webapp calls to localhost endepoints. @frontend @done(17-11-22 03:17)
    add config for changing endpoint base urls
    look for environemt variables in webpack
      ✔ make config @done(17-11-14 04:39)
      ✔ webpack build should know what environment to build for @done(17-11-14 05:30)
      ✔ use config value for base urls when using api @done(17-11-14 06:27)
    ☐ look into form.parse callback @api
    ✔ FIX: temporary folder should not show up in root.. @api @done(17-11-22 03:30)
      hide it or better yet, make a folder for pot-api related files and make separate folder for destination and temporary files
      CORRECTION: formidable api can just use the temporary folder of the computer. idk the implications but thats all simpler and easier
      ✔ remove/comment creation of temp folder @done(17-11-22 03:30)
    ☐ potapi closes on unhandled exceptions @api
    ☐ make api as restful as current knowledge can make
    look into error handling in express docs 
    ✔ upload file creates its own folder @api @done(17-11-12 08:53)
    remove mkdir from upload file
    ✔ browse endpoint should not show the whole path to the file @api @done(17-11-12 08:54)
      remove path property since it is not going to be used
    ☐ for directory component, add a component to contain each part of directory since they all have same style? (composition vs inheritance)
    ☐ list getting too long, page border doesnt adjust
    ☐ logs @api
    ✔ on startup, make sure destination exists @api @done(17-11-12 01:52)
      make sure the directory to upload files to, pointed in the config, exists, if not make it, if error, stop the application logging the problem
    ☐ make commands/build for production and dev @api
    ☐ make commands/build for production and dev @frontend
